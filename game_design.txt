Map-based games - policy making, resource management,

    - Health: containing virus epidemic 
        ("spreading" algorithm, tempered but not stopped by increased number of doctors and stopped by finding a vaccine)
        (vaccine, number of doctors, etc.) 
        (all dead in X turn, resource allocation for each turn)
    - Crime: managing police resources to minimize crime 
        (Criminality, Population satisfaction)
        (repress cancels crime in a given area for one turn but increases it the turn after if nothing is done)
        (repress, surveil, support)


Standard game loop:
    - Initial situation
    - Advice given (or not) => advisor provides a recommended split of resources OR a estimation of the result of the policy choice
    - Player decision
    - Resulting situation (feedback loop)



CRIME 

OUTCOMES:
    Population Satisfaction / Happiness (PopSat): Positive Social Impact => 1 to 100
        - Dimension 1: current level => 1 to 100 (1 is min satisfaction and 100 is maximum satisfaction)
        - Dimension 2: changing rate => 1.0 to ?? (is negatively correlated to Crime changing rate)

    Criminality Rate (Crime): Indicator of policy efficiency 
        - Dimension 1: current level => 1 to 100 (1 is almost no crime and 100 is maximum crime)
        - Dimension 2: changing rate => 1.0 to ?? (1.0 is no growth)
        

ALLOCATIONS => 100 points to allocate to a chosen split between the three policy measures
    1. Repress: Armed police send to location to catch criminals by all means necessary
        - Strongly reduces Crime but increases its growing rate (e.g. 1 Repress = -1 Crime and +0.01 Crime rate)
        - Strongly reduces PopSat (e.g. 1 Repress = -1 PopSat)

    2. Surveil: Send police to patrol the area to generate presence and gather information
        - Moderately decreases Crime and its growing rate (e.g. 1 Surveil = -0.5 Crime and -0.005 Crime rate)
        - Moderately decreases PopSat (e.g. 1 Repress = -0.5 PopSat)
    
    3. Support: Send funding for local communities (e.g Job support, basic education, etc.)
        - Strongly dampers the growing rate of Crime but no effect on its current level (e.g. 1 Support = -0.01 Crime rate)
        - Strongly increases PopSat (e.g. 1 Support = 1 PopSat)
